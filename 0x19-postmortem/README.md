**Postmortem: Web Application Outage Incident**

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:**
  - Start Time: January 22, 2018, 17:23 PST
  - End Time: January 22, 2018, 17:31 PST

- **Impact:**
  - Service: Holberton Schoolâ€™s WordPress application
  - User Experience: 100% of users faced a 500 Internal Server Error for approximately 8 minutes.

- **Root Cause:**
  - The outage stemmed from a typographical error in the WordPress application's configuration file (/var/www/html/wp-settings.php), leading to a critical error when attempting to load the file class-wp-locale.phpp instead of the correct class-wp-locale.php.

**Timeline:**

- **Issue Detection:**
  - January 22, 2018, 17:23 PST
  - Detected after a junior engineer deployed a WordPress update, resulting in a 500 status code.

- **How the Issue Was Detected:**
  - Automated monitoring alerted to increased error rates in the system logs.

- **Actions Taken:**
  - January 22, 2018, 17:25 PST
  - Checked running processes using `ps aux`, revealing Apache2 and MySQL running as expected. Suspected an issue with PHP/WordPress.

- **Misleading Investigation Paths:**
  - Initial focus on server logs and resources, with a temporary diversion to server capacity scaling due to high traffic suspicion.

- **Incident Escalation:**
  - January 22, 2018, 17:27 PST
  - Escalated to the DevOps and Networking teams for a deeper analysis.

- **Resolution:**
  - January 22, 2018, 17:30 PST
  - Identified the root cause: a typographical error in the configuration file causing the application to attempt loading a non-existent file.
  - Immediate fix: The typo was corrected using `sed -i 's/phpp/php/' /var/www/html/wp-settings.php`.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:**
  - A typographical error in the configuration file led to an attempt to load a non-existent file, class-wp-locale.phpp, causing a critical error.

- **Resolution:**
  - Corrected the typo in the configuration file, replacing the erroneous .phpp extension with .php.
  - Deployed the fix on the individual server and created a Puppet manifest (0-strace_is_your_friend.pp) for large-scale automation.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement rigorous testing procedures before deploying updates to catch errors like typos.
  - Enhance monitoring systems to provide early warnings about abnormal error rates and application failures.
  - Conduct regular reviews of critical configuration files for potential errors.

- **Tasks:**
  - Develop and implement automated tests for critical configuration files in the CI/CD pipeline.
  - Integrate uptime-monitoring services like UptimeRobot to receive instant alerts upon website outages.
  - Conduct training sessions for operations teams on identifying and troubleshooting configuration file errors effectively.

**Summation:**

In summary, the outage was caused by a simple typographical error, showcasing the significance of thorough testing and vigilant monitoring in the deployment process. The incident prompted the creation of a Puppet manifest for automated resolution and highlighted the importance of ongoing preventive measures to maintain a stable web application. As programmers, acknowledging the potential for errors and actively implementing measures to prevent recurrence remains pivotal in ensuring system reliability.
