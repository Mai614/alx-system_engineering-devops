Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: January 21, 2024, 14:30 UTC
End Time: January 21, 2024, 17:45 UTC
Impact:
Brace yourselves! Our primary web application took an unscheduled siesta, causing a 30% user accessibility dip. Users experienced slow page loads and encountered errors like they were on a treasure hunt.
Timeline:

14:30 UTC:
Monitoring alarms went berserk, like a caffeinated rooster on steroids.
14:35 UTC:
Our Sherlock Holmes of code, the on-call engineer, donned the virtual deerstalker and plunged into the mystery.
14:45 UTC:
Initial guess: The database was on strike. Investigated server logs and network configurations, hoping the database wasn't moonlighting as a prankster.
15:15 UTC:
Took a detour into the labyrinth of database performance metrics. Sadly, no Minotaur, just dead-ends.
15:30 UTC:
Summoned the Database Avengers (a.k.a. database administration team).
16:00 UTC:
Unmasked the villain! A bug in a recent schema update was sabotaging a critical database query.
16:30 UTC:
Rolled back the rogue schema update, rescuing our web app from the clutches of chaos.
17:00 UTC:
Checked for any lingering gremlins. All systems flashed a thumbs-up.
17:45 UTC:
Declared victory! The web stack outage had retreated like a ninja in the night.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
A gremlin disguised as a bug infiltrated our recent schema update, causing mischief in a crucial database query.
Resolution:
Deployed the rollback Bat-Signal and applied a hotfix faster than the Flash on espresso.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To Improve/Fix:
Beef up pre-deployment testing; we need more guard dogs and fewer gremlins.
Supercharge monitoring for specific database queries, so bugs can't hide in the shadows.
Establish a communication hotline for incidents, because carrier pigeons are so last century.
Tasks:
Train our code monkeys in the art of automated testing for database schema changes.
Put the database on a fitness regimenâ€”comprehensive review of query performance.
Upgrade our incident response manual from Morse code to 5G speed.
Schedule a post-incident party meeting, because who said post-mortems can't be fun?
Conclusion:
In the grand spectacle of the Web Stack Outage Extravaganza, a mischievous bug gatecrashed our schema update, causing brief pandemonium. Fear not, brave users! We've rolled back the red carpet, patched things up, and are now on a quest for preventative measures to keep our digital kingdom secure. Stay tuned for more tech adventures! ðŸš€âœ¨
